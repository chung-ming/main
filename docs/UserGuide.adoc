=== Standardizing Command Formats

The following covers the standard format to be used for all the commands in TravelBuddy and the syntax that follows:

[WARNING]
The code in this section is merely for illustrative purposes. It is kept brief to highlight the formatting standards for all the commands and not the actual commands themselves. Do not copy and paste the commands in this section.

* _Some commands may have a shortcut, which you can use to execute the command._ +
*Example:* For `add`, its shortcut is `a`. Hence, you can either type `add n/Botanic Gardens` or `a n/Botanic Gardens`.

* _Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters that you have to supply._ +
*Example:* For `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be substituted to be `add n/Botanic Gardens`.

* _Items in square brackets are optional._ +
*Example:* For `add n/NAME [t/TAG]`, it can either be specified as `add n/Botanic Gardens t/faculty` or as `add n/Botanic Gardens`.

* _Parameters can be in any order._ +
*Example:* If the command specifies the parameters `n/NAME r/RATING`, then changing the order to `r/RATING n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* _Whenever there are duplicate parameters, the last duplicated parameter is chosen._ +
*Example:* If the command is `add n/Singapore Zoo n/Botanic Gardens`, where there are duplicates of the `n/NAME` parameters, the last parameter, `n/Botanic Gardens`, is chosen to be added to the list of places.

* _Some parameters have a specific input format._ +
*Example:* For `dv/DATE_VISITED`, the `DATE_VISITED` needs to follow the `DD/MM/YYYY` format.

=== Seeking Help: `help`

*Description:* The `help` command opens up a help page.

*Shortcut:* `he`

*Format:* `help`

[NOTE]
The help page will be shown in another window, but you can resize and move it
around. This can be useful to refer to when using the app.

*Description:* The `generate` command generates charts based on the list of places in TravelBuddy. TravelBuddy serves up three charts (<<Chart_Combined>>) that are the most relevant to you as a traveler:

* The number of places visited for each country
* The number of places visited for each rating category
* The number of places visited for each year

*Shortcut:* `g`

*Format:* `generate`

*Preconditions:* Given below is a list of preconditions that must be met for the `generate` command to work:

* By default, the charts are automatically generated each time TravelBuddy loads.
* The `generate` command always triggers the display of all three charts, as seen in <<Chart_Combined>>.
* The charts always update themselves in real-time. +
*_Example:_* When a place is added via the `add` command, the charts are automatically updated so that no `generate` command is necessary.
* If the list is empty, the `generate` command will not display any charts (<<Generate_ListIsEmpty>>).
* You can type in any parameters after the `generate` command, TravelBuddy will simply ignore them (<<Generate_BeforeParamAfterParam>>).

Please refer to the section below.

=== Data and Storage Issues
*Q*: *How do I transfer my data to another computer?* +
*A*: First, install the TravelBuddy on the other computer. +
Next, copy the `TravelBuddy.json` data file from your current TravelBuddy. It is located in the same folder as the `TravelBuddy.jar` program. +
Finally, paste the `TravelBuddy.json` data file in the folder of your new `TravelBuddy.jar` program. When a warning box appears with the messages
"There is already a file with the same name in this location.", select "Copy and Replace".

*Q*: *How do I send my TravelBuddy to someone else?* +
*A*: You can send the person (via E-mail or messenger applications) your `TravelBuddy.json` data file. It is located in the same folder as the `TravelBuddy.jar` program.

*Q*: *Can I reset my TravelBuddy to the state it was when I first launched the application?* +
*A*: You can simply repeatedly run the `undo` command until there are no further commands to undo.

*Q*: *Why is my TravelBuddy empty?* +
*A*: If you are just starting out, please refer to Setting Up section. Otherwise, an empty TravelBuddy may mean that your data has been cleared by commands,
or the `TravelBuddy.json` data file is missing or corrupted. +

Please check that the file is located in the same folder as the `TravelBuddy.jar` program executable, and
the file can be opened by a text editor such as NotePad.

=== Command Issues

*Q*: *How do I view the full TravelBuddy after searching or selecting an entry?* +
*A*: You can use the command `list` to retrieve the full TravelBuddy.

* Name of the place (Prefix: `n/`)
* Country code of the place (Prefix: `cc/`)
* Date the place was visited (Prefix: `dv/`)
* Rating of the place (Prefix: `r/`)
* Description of the place (Prefix: `d/`)
* Address of the place (Prefix: `a/`)

*Q*: *What details are optional for the `add` command?* +
*A*: The following details are optional for a valid `add` command:

* Tags of the place (Prefix: `t/`)
* Filepath of the photo file for the place (Prefix: `p/`)

*Q*: *Why does the `undo` command not work?* +
*A*: The `undo` command only reverses the commands `add`, `delete`, `deletem`, `generate`, `edit` and `clear`.

*Q*: *Why does the `undo` command reverse a command from multiple commands before?* +
*A*: The `undo` command reverses the last used `add`, `delete`, `deletem`, `edit`, `generate` and `clear` command.
