== Overview

This document serves to highlight my contributions to *TravelBuddy*, a travel journaling application. +

TravelBuddy gives travelers simple tools to pen down their trip details. As every journal entry
in *TravelBuddy* is a Place, travelers can also include a photo, rate the place out of 5 stars, tag the Place with custom tags,
and pen down other personal information about the place, breathing life into an otherwise lifeless application.

TravelBuddy also gives travelers the means to make sense of their data, via simple data visualization. Together with intuitive search
functionality, TravelBuddy also gives travelers new insights about their adventures.

*TravelBuddy* was built as part of the CS2103 Software Engineering module in the National University of Singapore, in which link:https://cs2103-ay1819s2-w11-3.github.io/main/AboutUs.html[my team and I] were tasked to
morph an existing link:https://se-education.org/addressbook-level4/[Address Book] software product, and turn it into a new product -- *TravelBuddy*. The full source code for *TravelBuddy* is available link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W11-3/main[here].

== Summary of Contributions

This section gives an overview of my contributions to the development and testing
of the software. A more detailed sample of my contributions to the User Guide and Developer Guide
can be found below in <<User Guide Contributions>> and <<Developer Guide Contributions>> .

=== Major Enhancement: Photo Functionality
Photo functionality refers to the ability to include an image file with a user-defined Place. This functionality includes the ability to:

* *Add a photo* to a Place +
When using the `add` command to add a Place, users can specify the absolute file path of their desired photo with a `p/` prefix.
The photo will then be displayed at the top of the expanded Place view.

* *Replace the existing photo* of a Place +
Using the `edit` command, users can specify the file path of a new photo with the `p/` prefix.
The existing photo will then be replaced with the new photo at the top of the expanded Place view.

*Justification:* Photographs spark memories and invoke feelings; they are an indispensable part of any travel journal. +

Photos also serve to complement the existing textual information about a Place. A 5-star rating of a restaurant may not
mean much on its own, but when paired with the mouth-watering photo of a juicy leg of lamb, its impact is enhanced.

*Highlights:* The nature of this enhancement requires updates in and integration with multiple components, more below:

* `Logic` - Photos are attached to Places via the `add` command and replaced via the `edit` method. +
Hence, changes to `addParser` and `ParserUtil` were also needed to take into account the `p/` prefix.

* `Model` - Extensive changes to the `Model` was needed to include the Photo `filepath` string.

* `Storage` - The `filepath` string must be stored in a new field within `TravelBuddy.json`.

* `UI` (User Interface) - If an included photo is present, it must be displayed in the expanded Place view. Otherwise, no image is displayed.

*Code contributed to major enhancement*: [link:https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#search=shaun&sort=displayName&since=2019-02-10&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[RepoSense]] [link:{repoURL}/pulls?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Apr+author%3Ashaungohsc+label%3Atype.Enhancement+[Functional code]]

=== Minor Enhancement: View Switching between Place view and Chart view

On calling the `generate` command, the Chart view is displayed to the user. On calling the `select` command, the expanded Place view is displayed to the user.

*Justification:* Splitting the usable User Interface (UI) space into half, one for Chart and another for an Expanded Place details, reduces the screen real estate for both. +

The use of `generate` and `select` commands to change views provides full real estate for both features. Chart view can subsequently accommodate more charts,
while Expanded Place view can display more information while providing a pleasant User Experience.

*Highlights:* A robust event-handling system like above requires updates to multiple components involved in the Model-View-Controller pattern:

* `Model` - An `Observable` property is needed to reflect the view state.

* `Logic` - The helper methods of the `Observable` property require implementation.

* `UI` (User Interface) - A parent panel is needed to house both the Chart view panel and the Expanded Place view panel.
It also needs to be responsible for view switching.
