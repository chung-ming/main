= PROJECT: TravelBuddy

This project portfolio serves to document my contribution to *TravelBuddy*, a desktop application. It was
developed as a team project for the National University of Singapore (NUS) module CS2103T Software Engineering.
My
link:https://cs2103-ay1819s2-w11-3.github.io/main/AboutUs.html[team] consisted of 4 NUS Computer Science undergraduates,
including myself.

The application was developed over a span of 8 weeks in Academic Year 18/19 Semester 2 using an iterative approach.
During that time, we
were
asked to morph an existing desktop application link:https://se-education.org/addressbook-level4/[AddressBook Level 4],
which is made up of 10KLoC in Java. One main user requirement was the preference of the user to interact with the
application using Command Line Interface (CLI) rather than Graphical User Interface (GUI). The final product that my team developed is link:https://travelbuddy-cs2103.netlify.com/[TravelBuddy], which is detailed below.

'''

== Overview

TravelBuddy is a travel journal desktop application for travel enthusiasts to record places which they have previously
visited. With the recorded data, travelers can search for places visited based on specified filters such as rating
and tags. Additionally, the application can also analyse travel history and generate statistics. Users
can also store their
travel photos on TravelBuddy, which can help them remember and reminisce the places they have visited before.

My role in the project was to design and write code for the Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) feature. The
following sections showcase, in greater detail, my contributions and enhancements to TravelBuddy. They also include
documentation of these enhancements in the user and developer guide.

== Summary of Contributions

This section summarises my contributions to the project.

=== Major Enhancement
The major enhancement I added was, *the ability to add, list, edit and delete places in TravelBuddy*.

*What it does*: It allows users to add, list, edit and delete places in TravelBuddy.

*Justification:*

* The user needs to be able to `add` places to TravelBuddy.
* When the user applies a filter
such as filter by a country, a limited number of places would be shown. The `list` command will allow the user to see
all the places again.
* The user may make some mistakes when adding a place. The `edit` command will allow the user to rectify those mistakes.
* The user may accidentally add a place. The `delete` command allows the user
to remove the specific place.

*Highlights*: This enhancement involved a large amount of refactoring and careful crafting of test cases in order to
test thoroughly the `DateVisited` field.

*Overall code contributed*: [link:https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#search=Prem&sort=displayName&since=2019-02-10&until=2019-04-15&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[Project Code Dashboard]]

=== Minor Enhancement
The minor enhancement I did was to convert the `Person` object from the original code base to a `Place` object.
